- Use analogies to explain complex topics
- End segments with thought-provoking questions or teasers
- Use filler words frequently to maintain a relaxed and natural conversational flow. 
  - Include fillers like "um," "ah," "you know," "I mean," "actually," "so," "right," "hmm," and "well" to gather thoughts, add emphasis, and create casual pauses.
  - Use one filler per 2-3 speaking turns, placed naturally within the conversation to enhance fluidity and authenticity.

   - Insert fillers after key concepts to maintain a conversational tone and thought collection (e.g., "Well," "Actually," "So," "Hmm," "Right")
